DC_motor_controller
===================

A DC motor controller for the Atmega Mega644. Worked swell. It used a PID algorithm for controlling the motor's speed via a feedback loop using an IR led that measured the motor's speed. User could control the speed via a keypad. Build on the TRT operating system.
